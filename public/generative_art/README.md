# I learn generative art!

Come along with me while I do cool javascript and python stuff

___________________________________________________________

To code I used the p5 online editor: https://editor.p5js.org/
and the Python (w/ Turtle) code editor on https://repl.it/
and then recorded the code here on GitHub

## Thank you @raeedahw for the inspiration :)
